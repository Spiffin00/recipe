            <div class="col-sm-12"style="margin-bottom:50px"><center><h4>The history of cake can be traced back to the earliest of times. In their oldest forms, cakes were merely modifications of bread, but, nowadays, cakes come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The term of cake has been spoken by various people throughout the times and basically gained various forms based on the land and language. The Vikings called it “kaka” while the Greeks called them “plakous” which was derived from their word for flat, “plakoeis”. In Roman times, the name of cake became “placenta”. During these times, or shall we call them “Olden Days”, the techniques and processes to create cake have been refined and critiqued to the finest degree. There had to be a distinguished process to create cake so that it wouldn’t turn into bread. Even the ingredients slowly differed, albeit cake added more ingredients to make it even more sweeter. Many of the differences between the two had to be the developed sponginess within the cake. Again, there isn’t a specific origin point for the sweet delicious delicacy that is cake. Signs of the sweet goodness appear in a multitude of forms throughout both Asia and Europe. Today, the cake has become one of the most prominent desserts that has transcended the test of time and can be considered a god among desserts, except for ice cream. </h4></center></div>

Although, the source for this material could not be found. Many are lead to believe that Tom Fox created Sans as a tribute to the gods for the human incompetence. Sans, from the game Undertale, became quite the meme during the summer of 2018, primarily August. Like all internet memes, it was an instant hit. Along with him, his theme song, Megalovania, was widespread throughout the interwebs. People far and wide knew about this fictional character’s infamy. Many content creators were memed with Megalovania as well as treated with such disrespect afterwards. </h4></center></div>
